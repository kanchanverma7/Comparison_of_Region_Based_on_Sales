# Sales Comparison Dashboard

This project is designed to help visualize and compare sales data between two regions for a leading organization. The dashboard aims to provide insights into the performance of each region and suggest necessary improvements based on the sales data.

## Objective

Create a dashboard using Tableau to visualize the sales comparison between two selected regions, helping the organization understand the performance and make informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Sample Superstore** dataset.

## Features

- Visualize sales data for two selected regions.
- Compare sales performance between the regions.
- Provide insights and suggestions for improvement based on the data.

## Steps to Create the Dashboard

1. Data Preparation:
   - Load the **Sample Superstore** dataset into Tableau.
   - Clean and preprocess the data if necessary (e.g., handling missing values, filtering relevant columns).

2. Creating Visualizations:
   - **Sales by Region:** Create a bar chart or line graph to show total sales for each selected region.
   - **Sales Trend Over Time:** Create a trend line to visualize how sales have changed over time in each region.
   - **Top Products:** Highlight top-performing products in each region using bar charts or tables.
   - **Sales Distribution:** Use pie charts or donut charts to show the distribution of sales across different categories in each region.

3. Dashboard Design:
   - Combine the visualizations into a single dashboard.
   - Use filters to allow users to select and compare different regions dynamically.
   - Add titles, labels, and tooltips to make the dashboard user-friendly and informative.

4. Interactivity:
   - Enable interactive filters and drill-downs to explore the data in more detail.
   - Add actions to navigate between different views or highlight specific data points.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive dashboard for comparing sales data between two regions using Tableau. The visualizations help the organization understand the performance and make informed decisions to drive improvements.
